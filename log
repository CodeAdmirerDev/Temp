If you want a simpler logging setup in ASP.NET Core without needing extensive configuration files, you can use the built-in logging provider with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. This allows you to log to the console, debug output, or to a file with minimal configuration.

Here’s how you can set up lightweight file-based logging in ASP.NET Core without log4net or other complex setups.

Step 1: Add File-Based Logging with Serilog
Using Serilog for lightweight logging to a file is straightforward and requires minimal setup. Here’s how you can do it:

Install Serilog Packages: Run the following commands to install Serilog and its file sink:

bash
Copy code
dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.File
Configure Serilog in Program.cs: Add a simple configuration in Program.cs to use Serilog for logging directly to a file.

csharp
Copy code
using Serilog;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure Serilog for file logging
builder.Host.UseSerilog((context, services, configuration) =>
{
    configuration
        .WriteTo.Console()  // Optional: logs to console
        .WriteTo.File("Logs/log.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day); // Logs to file
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello, World!");

app.Run();
This configuration will:

Create a Logs directory in your project folder (if it doesn’t already exist).
Log entries will be written to a daily rolling file named log.txt in the Logs folder.
Step 2: Using the Logger in Controllers or Services
Serilog integrates with ILogger<T>, so you can inject and use it as you would any ILogger.

Here’s an example controller that uses the logger:

csharp
Copy code
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace YourNamespace.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("[controller]")]
    public class SampleController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ILogger<SampleController> _logger;

        public SampleController(ILogger<SampleController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult Get()
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("Get method called in SampleController.");
            return Ok(new { Message = "Hello, World!" });
        }
    }
}
Notes
No Extra Configuration File Needed: Serilog is configured directly in Program.cs, so there’s no need for additional .config files.
Rolling Logs: The rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day option automatically creates a new log file each day.
Minimal Dependencies: This setup only requires two additional packages (Serilog.AspNetCore and Serilog.Sinks.File).
Additional Customization
If you’d like to log only specific levels, you can add filters directly in Program.cs:

csharp
Copy code
configuration.MinimumLevel.Information();  // Log only Information level and above
This is a minimal, file-based logging solution with easy setup and configuration, ideal for straightforward logging needs. Let me know if you have further requirements!
