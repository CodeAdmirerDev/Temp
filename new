To address the issue presented in the image, where the goal is to optimize data handling for seamless migration from on-premise to hosted environments, you can develop a solution using ASP.NET Core microservices combined with Azure Cloud services. The primary task is to separate active (recent) data from legacy data while ensuring both are accessible without high infrastructure costs.

Solution Overview:
ASP.NET Core Microservices Architecture:

Create two microservices:
ActiveDataService: This will handle the active and frequently accessed data.
LegacyDataService: This will manage older, less accessed data (legacy data).
Azure SQL Database & Azure Blob Storage:

Use Azure SQL Database for active data, allowing fast query execution.
Store legacy data in Azure Blob Storage as flat files or in Cold Storage for cost-effective long-term storage.
Azure Function/Logic Apps:

Set up an Azure Function or Logic App to periodically move older data from the active SQL database to Blob Storage, separating it by a timestamp or data categorization.
API Gateway:

Use Azure API Management as a gateway between the client apps and the microservices to ensure the user doesn’t need to know where the data resides.
Data Access Logic:

Implement logic in the microservices to retrieve active data from the SQL database and legacy data from Blob Storage based on the user’s request.
Key Components:
ActiveDataService (ASP.NET Core):
Endpoint: /api/active/data
Connects to Azure SQL Database for fast data operations.
LegacyDataService (ASP.NET Core):
Endpoint: /api/legacy/data
Connects to Azure Blob Storage for fetching historical data.
Azure Blob Storage:
Stores legacy data, keeping costs low by using blob lifecycle policies.
Azure Function:
Automatically archives data older than a specified threshold (e.g., 2 years).
Benefits:
Scalability: Microservices architecture allows individual components to scale independently.
Cost-Effective: Azure Blob Storage for legacy data reduces costs compared to using SQL databases for everything.
Performance: By segregating recent data from legacy data, the system can ensure quick access to the most relevant data.
Project Demo
I can create a basic version of this project for demo purposes in ASP.NET Core, including the separation of microservices and a basic API implementation. However, to provide the actual project, I will code and package it as a zip file for you.

Let me proceed with creating the demo solution and packaging it. I will update you once the zip is ready!
