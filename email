Subject: Request for PR approval 

Hi ,

I hope you’re enjoying your vacation.

I wanted to provide a quick update regarding the PR approval. As we approach the Code Freeze deadline, it’s crucial to merge the changes promptly to stay on track. This process also includes completing the necessary NuGet updates.

If convenient, we kindly request your approval of the PR by 11:00 AM IST tomorrow. If you’re unavailable to review it by then, we will proceed with merging the changes to meet the deadline.

If any modifications are needed for this PR, I will address them and include the updates in the next PR.

Thank you for your understanding.
