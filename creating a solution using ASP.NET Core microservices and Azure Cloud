creating a solution using ASP.NET Core microservices and Azure Cloud for seamless migration of large customer databases from on-premises to hosted environments.

Key Points from the Image
Current Situation:
Historical Data: Some customers retain extensive historical data for compliance, leading to oversized databases.
Operational Efficiency: The large volume of data affects operational efficiency, such as during promotion imports/exports.
Objective:
Data Segregation: Develop a solution to separate active, recent data from legacy data.
Cost-Effectiveness: Ensure customers can access legacy data as needed without significantly increasing infrastructure costs.
Call to Action:
Innovative Proposals: Seek innovative proposals to efficiently manage data segregation while maintaining cost-effectiveness and accessibility for legacy data.

Step-by-Step Solution
Set Up Azure SQL Database:
Create an Azure SQL Database instance in the Azure portal.
Configure firewall rules to allow access from your on-premises network.
Develop ASP.NET Core Microservices:
API Gateway: Use Ocelot or another API Gateway library to route requests.
Data Ingestion Service: Connect to the on-premises database, extract data, and store it in Azure Blob Storage.
Transformation Service: Apply any necessary transformations to the data.
Data Migration Service: Load the transformed data into Azure SQL Database.
Use Azure Data Factory:
Create a pipeline to orchestrate the data movement from Blob Storage to Azure SQL Database.
Use Data Factory activities to copy data, run transformations, and monitor the migration process.
Implement Azure Functions:
Use Azure Functions to handle custom logic, such as data validation or notifications during the migration.
Secure Secrets with Azure Key Vault:
Store connection strings and other sensitive information in Azure Key Vault.
Access these secrets securely from your microservices.
Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a basic example of a Data Ingestion Service in ASP.NET Core:

C#

public class DataIngestionService
{
    private readonly string _connectionString;
    private readonly BlobServiceClient _blobServiceClient;

    public DataIngestionService(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _connectionString = configuration.GetConnectionString("OnPremDatabase");
        _blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(configuration["BlobStorageConnectionString"]);
    }

    public async Task ExtractDataAsync()
    {
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            await connection.OpenAsync();
            var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM YourTable", connection);
            using (var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync())
            {
                var blobContainerClient = _blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("migrationdata");
                await blobContainerClient.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();

                var blobClient = blobContainerClient.GetBlobClient("data.json");
                await using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
                {
                    using (var writer = new StreamWriter(stream))
                    using (var jsonWriter = new JsonTextWriter(writer))
                    {
                        var serializer = new JsonSerializer();
                        serializer.Serialize(jsonWriter, reader);
                        await jsonWriter.FlushAsync();
                    }
                    stream.Position = 0;
                    await blobClient.UploadAsync(stream, true);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

This example demonstrates how to extract data from an on-premises SQL Server and upload it to Azure Blob Storage. You can expand this to include transformation and migration logic.
